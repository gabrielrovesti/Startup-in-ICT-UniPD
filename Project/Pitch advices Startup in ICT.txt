Advices I got on the pitch:

- First of all you should know about your budget because the person that came with prof she is also accountant so know about numbers - investor is Silvia Tessari, famous accountant in Padova

- She did some questions which were not even in the course, so be prepared to abstract a bit

- Then prepare your lean canvas it does not need put it in presentation but add it at the end of slides which we did because probably prof wants to know about Unfair advantages and etc. - so, add some backup slides in case

- Also it's good to write about stock percentage of team and specify that they are working full time or part time. It's not obligation but accelerator will asked who is working for full time
