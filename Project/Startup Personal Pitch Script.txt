Key points about Startup presentation

# Who I am and What I do

- Hi everybody, I'm Gabriel
- I'm a Computer Scientist aspiring to be a professor or to find a work related to teaching/helping other people, working also as a tutor and a freelance teacher privately.
- I don't like staying in one place, I like working and committing myself to stuff hoping to make a change, for me and for everybody else
- Apart from this, I have personal goals, which motivate me to work more than anything else, for personal progress and coming out from personal situations I don't want
- Studying and learning are my passion, also very much a music fan more than anything else

# Problem speaking up

- I feel like one persistent problem with the society as a whole is the lack of empathy between people and, more in general, the lack of personal freedom
- If I was to make a company, it would be something dedicated to social, helping people and creating activities, thanks to a small group of people, to help socializing, studying and solving ordinary problems without judgement
- Changing the world starts from simple things and from the people, that's what I envision, the light in each one of us

# Conclusion
- Thank you all for listening and for your attention
